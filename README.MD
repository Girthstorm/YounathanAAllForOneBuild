I made a website that used the api's we previously made this year and hosted the api's on Azure.

Peer Review:By: All and all everything functional no issues but I'd instead make one js and assign each variable differently but hey we do it all differently. I did.t see any issues regarding the logic of it and the html looks centered and where it's so post to be. Great Job I can see you took a long time to do this.
